        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated software engineer with a unique background as a competitive gamer, bringing a results-driven mindset and strong problem-solving approach to my work. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Seattle Pacific University in June 2019 and began my career with a software engineering internship that year. After completing a full-stack immersive bootcamp at App Academy during the onset of COVID-19, I joined USAA as a Software Engineer in June 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            At USAA, I initially worked on the Bank OMNI Channel Salesforce team, where I gained experience developing Salesforce applications, working with Apex, and creating custom objects. I played a key role in developing core features for various projects, including implementing advanced search functionality and migrating projects from SharePoint to Salesforce. Additionally, I contributed to securing TALON projects by addressing critical Twistlock vulnerabilities and maintaining Java/React-based systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In early 2023, I advanced to a Software Engineer 2 role within the Bank Eligibility team. Here, my primary responsibilities included maintaining and creating OpenL rules for the Bank Eligibility Profile Verification system, integrating them through APIs, and supporting the migration of legacy systems to AWS. This involved hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure technologies such as Terraform, Lambda, S3, and more. I also contributed to dependency management, vulnerability remediation, and system stability through regular bug fixes, code updates, and unit/Cypress test maintenance.

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I have a strong passion for video games, fitness, and reading. I have played semi-professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Valorant, and enjoy immersive experiences in Blizzard games such as Diablo, StarCraft, and WarCraft. I’m also an avid reader, with favorite books including <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle</em> by Patrick Rothfuss and <em>The Stormlight Archives</em> and <em>Mistborn</em> series by Brandon Sanderson.
