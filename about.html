      <p>
        I'm a <span class="highlight">mid-level full-stack engineer</span> with 4+ years of
        enterprise experience at <span class="highlight">USAA</span>. I hold a B.S. in Computer
        Science from Seattle Pacific University and a full-stack certification from App Academy.
        I specialize in <span class="highlight">Java/Spring Boot and React</span>, with a track
        record of delivering cloud migrations, security initiatives, and reliable verification
        systems at scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a <span class="highlight">Software Engineer II</span>, I've architected OpenL business
        rules for the Bank Eligibility Profile Verification system, led the migration of the
        Profile Recovery Reconciliation service from JBoss to AWS, and redesigned the Profile
        Verification Web Takeover page to reduce failures during high-traffic identity checks.
        I've also spearheaded a <span class="highlight">Twistlock vulnerability remediation
        initiative</span>, conducting security assessments across containerized services and
        coordinating cross-team fixes.
      </p>

      <p>
        I focus on <span class="highlight">system stability, code quality, and automation</span>
        — enforcing standards through CI/CD pipelines, automated unit/Cypress testing, and
        thorough peer reviews.
