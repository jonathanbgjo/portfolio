        I’m a <span class="highlight">Software Engineer</span> with a B.S. in Computer Science 
        from Seattle Pacific University (2019) and a full-stack certification from App Academy. 
        Since 2021, I’ve been at <span class="highlight">USAA</span>, building applications across 
        Salesforce (Apex, custom objects, migrations), Java/React front-ends, and working on 
        vulnerability remediation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I’m a <span class="highlight">Software Engineer 2</span> on the Bank Eligibility team, 
        specializing in OpenL rules, API integrations, and AWS cloud migrations 
        (Terraform, Lambda, S3). I focus on <span class="highlight">system stability, dependency management, 
        and code quality</span> through thorough testing and automation.
